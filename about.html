    <h1>About Budget Travel India Guide</h1>
    <p>
      Budget Travel India Guide was created to help students, young professionals, and families explore India and nearby countries without overspending.
      The goal is simple: <strong>travel more while spending less</strong>, through smart planning, budget stays, and local experiences.

      This website focuses on practical advice: how to find cheap flights, where to book hostels and homestays, how to travel safely as a solo traveler,
      and how to design low-cost itineraries from major Indian cities. Every guide is written with a real Indian traveler in mind – INR budgets, realistic
      travel durations, and cost-saving hacks.
    </p>

      This site is also part of an academic project for the course <strong>CSET489 – Search Engine Optimization</strong>, demonstrating SEO best practices such as keyword optimization,
      internal linking, clean URL structure, mobile responsiveness, and performance-focused design.

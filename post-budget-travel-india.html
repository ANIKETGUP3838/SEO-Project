      <h2>Why India is Perfect for Budget Travel</h2>
      <p>
        India is one of the best countries in the world for travelling on a small budget. You can find hostels under ₹500,
        filling meals under ₹150, and overnight buses or trains that cover long distances for a fraction of what a flight costs.
        With smart planning and flexible dates, it is possible to take memorable trips even as a student or beginner traveler.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Tips to Reduce Your Travel Costs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Book trains and buses early:</strong> Use IRCTC, state bus portals, and apps like RedBus to get cheaper seats.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel in the shoulder season:</strong> Avoid long weekends and peak holidays to get lower prices on stays and transport.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay in hostels or homestays:</strong> Platforms like Zostel, GoStops, and Airbnb often have budget options.</li>
        <li><strong>Use local transport:</strong> City buses, metro, shared autos, and local cabs are usually much cheaper than private taxis.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat where locals eat:</strong> Small cafés and local restaurants are both cheaper and more authentic than touristy spots.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Top Budget-Friendly Destinations in India</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Rishikesh, Uttarakhand:</strong> Yoga capital with Ganga ghats, affordable hostels, and adventure sports.</li>
        <li><strong>Kasol & Parvati Valley, Himachal:</strong> A backpacker favourite with riverside stays and easy treks.</li>
        <li><strong>McLeodganj, Himachal:</strong> Tibetan culture, monasteries, and budget cafés with mountain views.</li>
        <li><strong>Varkala, Kerala:</strong> Cliffside beach destination with relaxed vibes and affordable guesthouses.</li>
        <li><strong>Pondicherry:</strong> French-style streets, beaches, and cafés – perfect for a weekend under ₹5000.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Sample 5-Day Budget Itinerary</h2>
      <p><strong>Day 1–2:</strong> Travel overnight by bus/train to Rishikesh, explore ghats, café hopping, and Ganga aarti.<br/>
         <strong>Day 3:</strong> Adventure activity (rafting/zipline) and local sightseeing.<br/>
         <strong>Day 4:</strong> Short hike / nearby village visit.<br/>
         <strong>Day 5:</strong> Return journey.</p>

      <p>
        With careful choices of transport and accommodation, such a trip can often be done in under ₹6000–₹8000 per person from major North Indian cities.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Budget travel in India is not about cutting every expense; it is about planning better and spending on the experiences that matter most to you.
        Start with one destination, track your spending, and refine your personal travel style over time.
